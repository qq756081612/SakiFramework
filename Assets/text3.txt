The arrival of Venus has bought disaster to the snowfield...
I'd like to hear you screaming rather than singing
Stupid fools, leave this snowfield now!
Darn hunter who came to snatch the treasure, die!
Stupid hunter, the treasure is mine!
Using chariot can deal higher damage to the tower
Caution! Robot Engineer has the ability to destroy chariot
The Orc Boss Ox Chieftain has appeared, proceed to defeat
My Robot Engineer can give you a taste of destruction!
Evil Venus has appeared, proceed to defeat
Snowfield is filled with evil aura, find Colossus
Snow Ape Boss has been agitated, defeat it
Proceed to find traces of Colossus
Sigh, your hunter journey is still long, improve your hunt title
Young one, come and spar with me, I am not joking
Young one, where did I stop, sigh, I am old......
Young one, why are you not talking, I forgot where was I
As a hunter, go one step at a time, and one day we will be the Hunter King
Young one, as time passes, things forgotten......
(╰_╯), that is the last chance, I will teach you a lesson
Long time ago, I am also a famous person, handsome and popular......
Young people must be patience, why so rude
Young one, try it again and I will be mad
Drive the chariot to help us!
